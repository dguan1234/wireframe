# I'm Late!

## Overview


<ins><strong>Concept<strong><ins>

Iâ€™m late! is a game about a student running for the bus because he just missed it. As the player of the game you must jump over various obstacles on the road in order to keep up otherwise you will fall behind. The theme of this game is the ever demanding need for more time. As a human you never really notice you need more time until you are almost out of it. I wanted to convey the feeling of relatability because everyone has been late at least once in their life before.

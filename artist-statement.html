        In the game I'm Late! you play as a student that is late for the bus, chasing after in hopes to reach your class.
        The game is a simplistic sidescroller where you dodge potholes on the road. I chose to create all my assets for this project in ms paint because I wanted my game
        to give off a sense of nostalgia, linking back to the style of flash games you would play on websites as a kid on school computers.
        I decided on a simplistic theme of having the player be a stick figure with the playing field painted in strong static colors to give a sense of timelessness.
